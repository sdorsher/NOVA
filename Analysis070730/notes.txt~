need to finish filling in temp_to_filename with final file and replace old ones as I redo them

need to make sure something catches if top runs over NUMVOLTAGEPTS. retake data for these files?

also need to catch 999s in gain in stddev, also check for 999s in other places.

next: run loop over all files. produce output file to read into root. copy all files over to linux if necessary
next: write root script using TGraph to read and plot file produced by calcsheet.C called arrenhiusdata.txt

later: make sure it runs in root. translate it to use rootisms.
