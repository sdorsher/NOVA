need to finish filling in temp_to_filename with final file and replace old ones as I redo them

redo avg slope of invMdMdV. this really should use more than two
points. also, sometimes it is producing unrealistic (negative or very
small) results.


then: calibrate temperature in calcsheet program and redo plots. 

later: make sure it runs in root. translate it to use rootisms.
