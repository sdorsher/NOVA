need to finish filling in temp_to_filename with final file and replace old ones as I redo them


then: calibrate temperature in calcsheet program and redo plots. 

later: make sure it runs in root. translate it to use rootisms.
later: redo calculations for avg slope of invMdMdV in root. find best fit slope instead of avg slope.
